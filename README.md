# Gene_Annotation_Comparison
This project is to implement a user-friendly and interactive webpage. It's used to seek the developmental changes in the genome sequencing of Mus Musculus mouse. It's supposed to get us acclimated to relational database management systems and their processes such as creating tables, inserting data from a text file, dropping tables, querying information with the utilization of primary keys. We're using a cgi python script and parsing information from a text file. The project is a quintessential way of handling big data in order to analyze and interpret it.
