# Gene_Annotation_Comparison
This project is to implement a user-friendly and interactive webpage. It's used to reinforce our knowledge of biological terms such as genes, genome, etc. It's supposed to get us acclimated to relational database management systems and their processes such as creating tables, inserting data from a text file, dropping tables, querying information with the utilization of primary keys. It's necessary to use a cgi python script and parse information from a text file. The project is a quintessential way of handling big data in order to analyze and interpret it.
